    | Period    | Distance  | ∆SoH                                 |

    | 12 months | 8 421 km  | −2.77 :abbr:`pp (percentage points)` |
    +-----------+-----------+--------------------------------------+


*   A series of DC fast charges gave the SoH a temporary boost of 4.10
    percentage points.
*   In the year ending October 2019 the vehicle travelled 8 421 km and the SoH
    reduced by 2.77 percentage points.


Data

Battery parameters were recorded using `Leaf Spy for Android`_. The table below
shows the battery parameters for the year ending October 2020.

Observations
------------

1.  The count of Type 1 and 2 charges is higher than actual due to the Leaf's
    built-in charge timer recording one charge when the vehicle is plugged in,
    and a second when the timer initiates charging.

2.  The increase in SoH from 84.53% to 88.63% in October 2019 is due to nine
    quick charges with in a 36 hour period while making the delivery journey.

3.  In the year ending October 2019 the vehicle travelled 8 421 km and the SoH
    reduced 2.77 percentage points.

4.  Vehicle was parked under cover.
