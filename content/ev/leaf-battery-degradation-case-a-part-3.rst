Observations
------------

1.  The count of Type 1 and 2 charges is higher than actual due to the Leaf's
    built-in charge timer recording one charge when the vehicle is plugged in,
    and a second when the timer initiates charging.

2.  In the year ending October 2021 the vehicle travelled 9 379 km and the SoH
    reduced by 3.64 percentage points.
