Observations
------------

1.  The count of Type 1 and 2 charges is higher than actual due to the Leaf's
    built-in charge timer recording one charge when the vehicle is plugged in,
    and a second when the timer initiates charging.

2.  The increase in SoH from 81.20% to 86.27% in December 2020 is due to a
    series of quick charges made on an inter-city journey.

3.  In the year ending October 2021 the vehicle travelled 9 379 km and the SoH
    reduced by 3.64 percentage points.

4.  On 2021-09-26 it was observed that the eleventh battery capacity level bar
    had been lost.
