Observations
------------

1.  The count of Type 1 and 2 charges is higher than actual due to the Leaf's
    built-in charge timer recording one charge when the vehicle is plugged in,
    and a second when the timer initiates charging.

2.  In the thirteen months ending November 2022 the vehicle travelled 11 266 km
    and the SoH reduced by 5.08 percentage points.

3.  The vehicle was parked uncovered.
